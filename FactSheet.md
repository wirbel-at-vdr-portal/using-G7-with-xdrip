# G7 fact sheet

**This is the data found in the net for this sensor. Some data could be wrong.**

- **Glucose measurement range:**
  - 2.2 .. 22.2 mmol/l
  - 40 .. 400 mg/dl
- **Sensor session duration:**
  - 10 days, plus up to 12 hours
- **warm-up time:**
  - 30 minutes (<- sometimes xDrip+ waits 2 hours?)
- **Factory calibrated.**
  A calibration *can* be done, but is not required. Calibrating may increase or decrease accuracy.
- **Talks only every five minutes.**
  Between these five minute intervals, the sensors disconnects via Bluetooth and sleeps.
- **Works like a Sample and Hold system.**
- **Pressure dependency.**
  Applying pressure to the sensor may influence glucose readings. As soon as the pressure is gone, the measurements should return to normal reading.
- **Memory for up to 24 hours.**
  If no communication was possible, missing data is transferred on next communication.
- **Waterproof:**
  - up to 2.4m
  - up to 24 hours
- **Can be weared during flights.**
  - meets RTCA /DO-160 G 21, Cat M.
- **Storage temperature:**
  - 2 .. 30 °C
- **Working Height:**
  - -382 Meter .. 5000 m
- **Needs to be protected from**
   - X-Ray
   - CT
   - Radiation therapy
- **Communication:**
  - Bluetooth Low Energy
  - Frequency: 2.402–2.480 GHz
  - RF radiation: 1mW (EIRP)
  - Bandwidth: 1,07 MHz
  - Modulation: Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK)
  - Data rate: 1 Mbps
  - Range: vendor says up to 6m, in real life: 2..3m
