# Native Algorithm - yes or no?

In **Settings −> G5/G6/Dex1 Debug Settings −> Native Algorithm**, there is the choice of yes or no.

## Native Algorithm
- Calibration is done by the transmitter (G7).
- Backfill data = yes. In case of temporary missing connection, up to 3 hours of data is filled back into xDrip+.
- Session stops after 10days. If preemptive restart is enabled, may be up to 12 hours more.
- Factory calibration = yes.
- Relevant Calibration Graph = no.
- Clear calibrations = no. 

## Non-native Algorithm
- Calibration is done by xDrip+.
- Backfill data = no. In case of temporary missing connection, no data is filled back into xDrip+.
- Session does not stop after 10days.
- Factory calibration = no.
- Relevant Calibration Graph = yes.
- Clear calibrations = yes.
