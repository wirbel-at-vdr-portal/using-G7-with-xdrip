# Getting the very latest version

***IMPORTANT:*** **Do NOT uninstall xdrip+ for an update, just install the new version over the old one.** Otherwise you will loose all your settings.

If you want to get the very latest version, you have several choices.
Go to **Settings âˆ’> xDrip+ Update Settings**.
- **stable** version. A well checked, but several month old version
- **beta** (default)
- **alpha**
- **nightly** build, the latest fresh build version available from github.
- [building xDrip+ from sources](BuildingXdrip.md)

If you want the nightly build, most likely this option is not shown, until you choose alpha builds, close the settings window and reopen it.

## Undoing an update

If the last version works better for you, you may want to undo an update.

For this, just install the version you had previously.
