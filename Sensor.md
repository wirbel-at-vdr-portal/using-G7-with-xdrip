# How to exchange the G7 sensor

This is how i exchange the G7 sensors.

1. if there is an working or expired sensor, remove the old G7 from body.
Do not change anything in software yet.
2. remove *all* active Dexcom sensors nearby.
No such active sensor should be in possible reach of bluetooth for the next steps.
Be shure to put the old sensor far away.
3. Install the new sensor on the body as described by the vendor.
Don't put the sensor number before into xDrip+.
4. After the sensor is completly installed, check that bluetooth is enabled
5. Enter the four-digit number on the sensor case into xDrip+.
6. Open the system status page and keep it open.
Check regularly if you find state connected less that 5 minutes.
The first connection may take up to 20 minutes.
Keep the window open and the phone as near as possible to the sensor until you see, that the warming up phase is over.


The G7 is started *by installing it*. Usually, there's no need to send a 'Start Sensor' command.
