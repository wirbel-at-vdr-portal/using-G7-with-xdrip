# Configuring Alarms

One of the most important features are glucose alarms.
Actually, the ability to freely configure alarms thresholds was my reason to switch to xDrip.

## Checking Alarms and Changing Alarms Settings

Go to **Settings ->Alarms and Alerts -> Glucose Level Alerts List**.
Here you find the currently configured alarms. Most likely, you need two of them.
Long press on an alarms lets you configure it.
- threshold
- alarm sound
- default snooze time (important, such that you don't get alarmed over and over)

*At least* the low alarm should be configured and active, but likely you want the high alarm too.
